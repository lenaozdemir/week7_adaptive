## About
This project was one of my earliest exercises in frontend development.  
It contains a simple adaptive page structure with:
- Semantic HTML5 elements (`header`, `main`, `aside`, `footer`)  
- CSS Grid layout for the container  
- Basic styling for content sections  

## Status
- **Type:** Learning / Training project  
- **Created:** 2023

## Why Archived?
I keep this repository as a historical reference of my learning journey.  
It shows my first attempt at adaptive design and documents the starting point of my frontend path.
